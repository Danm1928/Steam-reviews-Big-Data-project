# Steam-reviews-Big-Data-project
This is a big data project done during my university studies using Python and the library PySpark. This was done on a large Steam reviews dataset and I aimed to identify some common words and pairs of words that were associated with positive and negative reviews.

The dataset can be found here: https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html#steam_data
